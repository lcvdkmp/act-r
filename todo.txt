Store all words in sentence?

NEW:

Find a way to retrieve something with either 
role subject or role object

Train model on data

Use the dataset of words for subsymbolic

Store subject and object in goal buffer (different type? just like normal
		parsing. We can then retrieve chunks of this type when recalling.
		preventing recalls of declarative memory)
Set spreading stuff for goal buffer so that retrieval time is quicker





- Parse nouns_RT file
- add intersect to trainer
- set up model correctly (with info on where the noun is ect)
