Store all words in sentence?

NEW:

Store words parsed in another way. THen retrieval on reference is possible

Use the dataset of words for subsymbolic

Make separate model for if noun is on third word?
Or change the model so that the first noun parsed is always regarded as an
object and second as a subject? This would allow all 32 sentences to be parsed
correctly. But we need info on what the subject and objects are??? or no?
